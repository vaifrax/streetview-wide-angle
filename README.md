streetview-wide-angle
=====================

interactive wide angle panoramic projections using google streetview

Usage: click in the map for a new location (must be within 50m to the next available google streetview data)

using GSVPano.js, the Google Street View Panorama lib by Jaume Sanches Elias (http://www.clicktorelease.com)

There are a few known issues with the projections and the code, it may be fixed at some point.

Thanks to Leo for the Moebius projection!
